## Hi there üëã

Hit Save! is a registered **501(c)(3) non-profit** dedicated to the preservation of video games, their history, and related physical and digital materials.
Our mission statement is:

‚ÄúTo advocate for, initiate, support, and maintain video game preservation efforts through community-driven projects‚Äù

We are working on:

 - long-term methodologies for scanning and preserving physical printed media
 - facilitation of recorded (both written & audio) interviews with people within the game development area
 - long-term strategies for preserving digital media

We do this by sponsoring individuals and groups with proper hardware, software, and guidelines, so that community-driven efforts can be as efficient as possible.

Through these efforts we hope that both current and future generations will be able to research video games, their history, and the stories of the people who made them.
